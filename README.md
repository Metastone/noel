# Noel

A highly advanced piece of software to organize a random gift exchange. Made initially to be used for Christmas with my family.

- Takes a list of forbidden groups (groups of people that can't give gifts to one another)
- Takes a list of forbidden transaction ('person A' gives a gift to 'person B')

# Dependencies

- PyYAML (to load the program configuration)
- "schema" python library (to validate the program configuration)
