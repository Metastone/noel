# Noel

Organize a random gift exchange. Made initially to be used for Christmas with my family.

- Takes a list of interdictions (groups of people that can't gift to one another)
- No isolated cycles (if you represent the output like a graph with peoples as nodes and "giving gifts" relations as edges)

# Dependencies

- PyYAML (to load the program configuration)
- "schema" python library (to validate the program configuration)
